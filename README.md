# my-database-learning-path
I am interested in learning more about database. Since database management is a huge task, we need to be concern about various  methods  of  database mangement.I am going to upload my learning materials here.

# COURSE :MySQL Database Administration: Beginner SQL Database Design
# COURSE INSTRUCTOR :Maven Analytics

# COURSE OUTLINE:



## SQL Intro & MySQL Setup

For students who haven't completed one of our other SQL courses, we'll demonstrate exactly how to download and install the tools that we'll need to access MySQL, including MySQL Community Server & MySQL Workbench. We'll share download guides for both Mac & PC, and run our first piece of SQL code to generate the project database that we'll analyze throughout the course.

## Creating, Altering, and Deleting Schemas & Tables

In this section we'll learn how to create schemas and tables using SQL code and with the Workbench UI tools. Then, we will learn how to alter tables by adding and removing columns. Finally, we will walk through dropping schemas and tables (be careful with this one).

## Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Records

After we get up to speed creating and altering tables, we will learn how to populate those tables with records of data, and update and delete records as needed.

## Database Design

Now that we have covered the basic mechanics, we will learn how tables relate to one another optimally, and discuss best practices for database design. We will explore the EER Diagram Editor, and you will have some opportunities to create your own database models.


# ***MID-COURSE PROJECT: Normalize this database for your client! 

### Advanced Concepts
In this section, we will get into concepts like adding an index to a column, imposing constraints, and creating stored procedures and triggers. This is powerful stuff! 

### Server & User Management
In our last section before the Final Project, we will learn how to monitor servers to make sure they are running, and how to restart them when needed. You will also get your hands on user management tools to assign roles and manage permissions, just like a real DBA.

# ***FINAL COURSE PROJECT: Design and build an entire database from scratch!
